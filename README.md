# Statistical Inference On General Social Survey (GSS) Dataset

In this project I have analyzed GSS dataset. 

I built the hypothesis using research question using three categorical variables and one datetime variable. It was related to whether genders who are unemployed also have suicidal thoughts?

The answer was found using one sided z-test.
